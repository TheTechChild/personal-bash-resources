# PBR Backup Manifest
#
# This file tells backup-pbr which external folders to include in your backup.
# Rename this file to backup-manifest.sh and uncomment/add entries below.
#
# Run: backup-pbr-init   (copies this example for you)
#
# Format: "label|macos_path|linux_path"
#   - label:      Short name used in the backup archive (no spaces or slashes)
#   - macos_path: Absolute path on macOS (use ~ for home directory)
#   - linux_path: Absolute path on Linux (use ~ for home directory)
#
# The backup will include these folders alongside your extensions.
# On restore, files are placed at the correct path for your current platform.
#
# WARNING: If you include SSH keys or tokens, the backup will be encrypted
# by default. You MUST remember the password — there is no recovery.
